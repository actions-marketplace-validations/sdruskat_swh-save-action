# Contributing

I happily accept contributions to this project! :tada:

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a new issue before making a change.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Please open pull requests as pull request drafts.
2. Update the `README.md` with relevant details of any changes you make.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples in the `README.md` and also in the `github/workflows/main.yml` (so that the new dog food you provide is eaten by the project upon merge) to the new version that your pull request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
3. All pull requests must be reviewed before they are merged. Please mark your pull request as ready for review and request a review once you are confident that your PR is good to merge.

Thanks for contributing!
